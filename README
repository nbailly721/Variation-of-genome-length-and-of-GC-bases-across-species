-This project investigates mitochondrial genome sequence length and GC content across multiple species by downloading raw genome data, processing it with shell scripting, and analyzing it with R.

##📁 Dataset

Mitochondrial genome FASTA files for human, mouse, cattle, and gorilla, downloaded from NCBI using the shell script.

mt_stats.tsv — Tab-separated file containing species names, genome lengths, and GC content percentages generated by the shell script.

##🔧 Tools & Packages

Shell Script:

Tools: wget for downloading sequences, standard Linux commands (grep, awk, tr) for processing.

Purpose: Download mitochondrial genome FASTA files, calculate genome size and GC content, output stats table.

R Script:

Language: R

Packages: tidyverse

Purpose: Load the genome statistics, explore the data, and create visualizations comparing genome size and GC content across species.

##📊 Workflow Overview
Shell Script

Download mitochondrial genome FASTA files for selected species from NCBI.

Calculate total genome length and GC content percentage for each species.

Save results to mt_stats.tsv.

R Script

Load the mt_stats.tsv data.

Perform basic data exploration and summary statistics.

Generate bar plots for genome length and GC content by species.

Create scatter plot to visualize correlation between genome length and GC content.

##📈 Key Results

Quantified differences in mitochondrial genome size and GC content across species.

Visual insights into the relationship between genome length and GC composition.

#3📂 Files

variation_genome_gc_download.sh: Shell script to download data and calculate genome stats.

variation_genome_gc_analysis.R: R script for data analysis and visualization.

mt_stats.tsv: Output data file containing genome length and GC content statistics.

##🧠 Notes

Genome sequences sourced directly from NCBI.

The pipeline can be adapted to include additional species or other genomic features.

Shell script output serves as input for the R analysis.

Figures showing the results are not included in the repository. To generate the plots and statistical results
,run the Shell script (variation_genome_gc_download.sh) in linux terminal and then the .tsv output
file in the R script (variation_genome_gc_analysis.R).
